# World Layoffs Data Cleaning & EDA (SQL)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and exploring a global layoffs dataset
to prepare it for analysis and uncover key trends.

## The workflow follows a real-world data pipeline:
Raw Data → Cleaning → Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench


  ## Data Cleaning Steps
The following steps were performed using SQL:
1. Created a staging table to preserve the raw dataset
2. Removed duplicate records using ROW_NUMBER()
3. Standardized company names and text fields
4. Converted blank values to NULL
5. Validated schema and record counts

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to understand:
- Layoffs trends over time
- Most affected countries and industries
- Companies with the highest layoffs
